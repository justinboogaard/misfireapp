// In this sample the app delegate maintains a property for the current
// active session, and the view controllers reference the session via
// this property, as well as play a role in keeping the session object
// up to date; a more complicated application may choose to introduce
// a simple singleton that owns the active FBSession object as well
// as access to the object by the rest of the application
